comments on velo stuff from Kumar for the following situation

[VelocityMode]
Iter = 5.000000
VMSampV = 400.000000
AperSec = 0.100000
SampFreqHz = 0.100000
AperFrac = 0.400000


This is what it is:
Sample frequency is 4 Hz (0.25 s). DVM aperture is 0.4*0.25= 0.1 s, and the displacement sampling pulse is also 0.1 s

He will change the .ini startin g with version 1.11
